## About
This website emulates the popular game Simon.

## Personal Story
I haven't programmed with web development in over 6 months and have forgotten quite a bit.
This is me returning to the basics and re-starting my full-stack journey in a way.

### How I plan to work differently this time round
I have noticed some problems with the way I previously wrote code, which I hope to improve on this time:
- Writing more comments
- Writing code summarize of different sections/files of code at start of said content
- Organizing code in the most efficient way (seperating to sections and adding titles)


# TODO

- Game logic
- Change darkness of colors+background slider
- Keep high score
